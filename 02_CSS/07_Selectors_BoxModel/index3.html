<!-- Create a div with id="motive", inside it write the text
"We are joining" followed by a span tag with class="ns"
and text "Newton School" inside it.

So the rendered output should be "We are joining Newton School", with just "Newton School" inside the span tag

For styling, give #motive element padding of 10px and background-color as black and a font color as white.

The span with class ns will have background-color as red. -->
