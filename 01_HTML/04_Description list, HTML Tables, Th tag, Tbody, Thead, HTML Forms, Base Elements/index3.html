<!--
    We serve a lot of delicious pizza, but we were never able to collect feedback from 
    the customers :(
Can you please make us a feedback form, it would be a great help for us ;)

For the test cases to get passed
The feedback form should contain the following input fields:

Input of type text with id #text, this will be a required field.

Input of type textarea with id #message, this will be a required field.

Input of type email with id #email, this will be a required field.

Input of type number with id #rate and range 0-5.

A button with id #submit.



Note: Every input must have a label with id #{inputid}-label. For example,

for the input field of id rate the label should have the id as rate-label,

for the input field of id text, the label should have the id as text-label.
